## Flow to the Future Hackathon

FlowBuddy was developed as part of the "Flow to the Future" hackathon, a global competition with a virtual format and over $500,000 in prizes. The hackathon welcomes web3 builders from all backgrounds and encourages exploration of the full potential of on-chain logic, ranging from sophisticated DeFi mechanics to interoperable gaming universes. The hackathon features six tracks: Gaming, AI, DeFi, Mobile, Tooling and Infrastructure, as well as a general track.

### Flow to the Future Manifesto

The Flow to the Future Hackathon embodies an environment for daring innovators and boundary-pushers in the web3 world. It invites pioneers to unlock the full potential of on-chain logic and create decentralized applications (dApps) that are sophisticated, innovative, and accessible to mainstream consumers, challenging traditional centralized models.

At the core of this adventure lies Cadence, Flow's revolutionary smart contract programming language. Cadence offers a secure and reliable environment for developers to represent complex interactions entirely on-chain. It is a language designed to be accessible while empowering developers to craft intricate logic, enabling the creation of entire worlds where a single smart contract forms the foundation for thousands of applications.

Flow's intuitive developer stack and advanced protocol-level features empower developers to embrace the power of composability. By developing applications that expand existing platforms and lay a strong foundation for future innovation, participants can contribute to shaping the next chapter of Web3.

Whether you are an experienced Flow developer or an ambitious web3 builder eager to explore beyond the constraints of Solidity/EVM, the Flow to the Future Hackathon provides the perfect opportunity to make your mark in the world of Web3.

### Track: AI <> Flow

FlowBuddy is built as part of the AI <> Flow track, focusing on the intersection of artificial intelligence and the Flow blockchain. The project aims to leverage AI technologies to enhance and streamline Flow development processes, opening up new possibilities and driving innovation in the field.
